<h3>Indian Festivals</h3>
<p>India is a land of festivals and fairs. Virtually celebrating each day of the year, 
there are more festivals celebrated in India than anywhere else in the world. Each festival pertains to different occasions,
 some welcome the seasons of the year, the harvest, the rains, or the full moon. Others celebrate religious occasions, the birthdays of divine beings and saints,
 or the advent of the New Year. A number of these festivals are common to most parts of India. However, they may be called by different names in various parts of
 the country or may be celebrated in a different fashion.
