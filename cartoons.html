<p>A cartoon is a type of illustration, sometimes animated, typically in a non-realistic or semi-realistic style.
 The specific meaning has evolved over time,
 but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; 
 or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation.
 Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a cartoonist.</p>
